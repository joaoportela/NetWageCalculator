NetWageCalculator - Portugal
============================

This project is a Calculator for the Net Wage, also know as "take home pay".
The calculations are made according to the Portuguese law.

We are basing our calculations on the information that can be found [in this

Important Disclaimer
--------------------

We are not layers. We will try our best to have the calculations as close to
what the law states as possible, but we **do not take any responsability for
errors in the calculations**. If you want to be completly sure you have to do
the calculations yourself.
